  question: "Do we sign up as individuals or as a team?",
  answer: "You can participate individually or as part of a group. If you want to challenge yourself, you are welcome to work alone. However, we definitely recommend working with a team. Teams can have up to 4 students, with no exceptions. We hope you can make a new friend and learn something new by talking to each other, our mentors, and our experts! If you are participating alone, you will also have the option of requesting that the organizers group you with other participants who share your research interests."
